      <p> The series has a lot of controversial reviews, bot positive and negative. <br> <br>
      
      Negative reviews: The novel and movie series received a lot of hate and is even banned in New Zealand. The country decided to do so after they received complaints from mental health bodies saying that it "glorified" suicide. But also people who watched it found the series too much. They thought it wasn't appropriate to be shown on tv and might cause people to copy it as it in their opinion "romanticized" suicide. <br> <br> People also say: "It is literally all about kids getting away with murder and avoiding any negative outcome. Even the sheriff knows the truth but refuses to arrest the murderer."  <br> <br> 
      Positive reviews: Apart from all the negativity the series might bring, it does help raise awareness and it helps people come to realize that even the people who seem the happiest might be struggling the most. As this review pointed out: "This series isn't a pleasant watch by any means, but it does raise vital issues that can inspire valuable discussions between parents and teens." making the importance of bringing awareness to this subject to the surface. <br> <br> 
      Some people say the series started off strong but slowly got worse by the season: "Season 1 was interesting, season 2 dragged on, season 3 got on my nerves and season 4 is just unwatchable." there are many more reviews stating the same thing.</p>

          13 reasons why is a movie series about a girl named Hannah Baker who got bullied into comitting suicide, this wasn't the only reason as to why she did it, she also got sexually abused and harassed by someone who she went to she same school with. <br> <br> Before she took her life she left behind 13 tapes handed out to each person who had something to do with her death, this included Bryce, Clay, Justin, Jessica, Tony, Zach, Alex, Marcus, Courtney, Sheri, Kevin and Tyler. <br> <br> The movie is mainly from Clay's perspective. Clay went to school with Hannah and worked at a movie theatre with her as his colleague. They grew pretty close and that was until she took her own life. <br> <br> Clay then started hallucinating and seeing Hannah appear in his dreams but also in his surroundings when he's awake.<br> <br>
      
      Clay wouldn't have been included in the tapes if it weren't for Hannah wanting him to hear her side of the story.<br> <br> Tony was the one making sure the tapes were passed on in order and that they weren't destroyed, he was also one of the last few people to see Hannah alive. </h6>

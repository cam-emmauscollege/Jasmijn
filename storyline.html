       <h2>A quick summary</h2>
        <h6>[ disclaimer: this topic might contain spoilers ]</h6>
        <br>
      In the beginning of the series, we quickly learn this story is going to be shown from the perspective of Clay Jensen. Clay receives a package of audiotapes addressed to him that are numbered from one to thirteen, and he begins listening to them in his garage after being convinced to by Tony. He listens to each of the tapes and learns about the incidents that led up to Hannah's suicide. <br> <br> The tapes are each addressed to a specific person, outlining how they hurt or affected her in some way. The people discussed in the tapes also received a map, which has locations marked that are mentioned throughout the tapes, so Clay switches to a Walkman to follow along with the locations. <br> <br> During this, Clay saw imaginations of Hannah that were sort of "haunting" him, which obviously drove him mad. The tapes discuss many things that happened to Hannah, including bullying, assault, and rumors. At the end of the first season, Clay sends the tapes to the next person on the tapes, which happened to be Mr. Porter. This tape is different from the other tapes. Hannah recorded the conversation between her and Mr. Porter takes place. In that conversation, Hannah tries to talk about the rape, but she is too afraid to mention a name or report it. Mr Porter tells her to just get over it and Hannah sees that as a slap in the face. She thinks no one cares enough about what happens to her. <br> <br>

    The day after Clay sends the tapes to Jenny, he is at school. He walks around and sees Skye, a girl who has changed since Clay was friends with her and doesn't look happy. Clay goes after her. He wants to do it right this time and help her.</p>

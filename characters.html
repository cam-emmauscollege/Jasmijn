       <ul> <li> Hannah: One of the lead characters. She was severely bullied on her previous school, this is why her parents moved and she eventually joined a new but also her last ever school. The bullying continued on her new school, which was one of the reasons she eventually committed. She also got sexually labelled, asssaulted and abused. </li> <li> Bryce: One of the darkest characters in the show, Bryce Walker. He was a real jock, being captain of the football team and pitcher on the baseball team. He also grew up in a wealthy family, but this caused him to be on his own often. He often took advantage of unconcious girls which he also did to Hannah. </li> <li> Clay: He is a 17 year old student at liberty high who lives with his parents. Unfortunately we didn't get to see much of Clay's backstory. He was Hannah's love interest and close friend. He was the only one who received the set of thirteen tapes, without taking a part in the reason of her death </li> <li> Justin: Justin was shown to have a difficult home life. His mother was a neglectful drug addict with a lot of dangerous and violent boyfriends, including Seth, who strangled Justin on screen and was was said to have abused him in the pas. It is also said that one of Jusin's stepfathers molested Justin when he was five. </li> <li> Jessica: One of Hannah's bestfriends before she died. She is a student and the Student Body President at Liberty High School and the ex-girlfriend of Alex Standall and Justin Foley. Her friendship with Hannah ended after they had a misunderstanding and a couple months later Hannah passed away. </li> <li> Tony: Also known as Antonio, is a high school student at Liberty High who helped Clay dealing with Hannah's death. He was also the person who saw Hannah get taken away in an ambulance right after she committed. But most importantly, Hannah gave him the task to make sure the tapes dont get destroyed as they were passed down. </li> <li> Zach: Zach lost his dad in the summer of 2017; he implied to having felt depressed and/or suicidal after his father's death. He is the subject of the seventh tape on Hannah's tapes, cause after being humiliated by Hannah, Zach got revenge on her by stealing and throwing away all of Hannahâ€™s notes in the Brown Paper Bag Program, notes that she desperately needed to gain comfort and confidence. </li> <li> Alex: best friends with Hannah and Jessica, but ends up becoming friends with the "popular" kids in school. Desperately wanting to fit in he takes part in to a "hot or not" list as a revenge for his breakup with Jessica, which leads to Hannah facing sexual harrassment. Throughout the season, he also feels guilty about his actions and goes as far as to attempt suicide. </li> <li> Marcus: He is the subject of "Tape 3, Side B", where he is responsible for humiliating Hannah in public on their One Dollar Valentine's date. </li> <li> Courtney: Courtney spread two sexual rumors about Hannah around the school to save her own reputation as she was too afraid to come out as lesbian. When a photo of her and Hannah kissing was leaked by Tyler, she says that the photo is of Hannah. She also adds by lying and saying Hannah went down on another boy, this boy had already said Hannah had sex with him so Courtney took advantage of the situation. </li> <li>Sheri: She is the subject of "Tape 5, Side B", where she was responsible for abandoning Hannah, after she crashed her car into a stop sign, which may have caused the death of another student, Jeff Atkins</li> <li>Kevin: He was the new counselor at Liberty High School and is the subject of the thirteenth and final tape made by Hannah, where he was responsible for not helping Hannah after she told him about her sexual assault and suicidal thoughts.</li> <li> Tyler: he is shown as the subject of "Tape 2, Side B", where he was responsible for photographically stalking Hannah Baker and spreading the photo he captured of Hannah and Courtney kissing to everyone in the school. </li>  <br>  </p> </ul>
